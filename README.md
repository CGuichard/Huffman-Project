# L3 ING Project - Huffman coding

The objective of this project is to propose a code allowing to apply a Huffman coding on ASCII text files to compress their data without loss of information

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you to get an executable file, as well as the method to use this executable

### Prerequisites

To compile the project you will need to use **make**. This command uses the file named Makefile and is used to compile the project. It is normally on all GNU Operating Systems

If it is not installed on your machine you will need to install it. This command can be found for example on Ubuntu in the build-essential package. You can install it as follows:

    sudo apt-get install build-essential

To learn how to install it on other operating systems, please check the correct documentation

*Learn more about [make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.pdf)*

### Compilation

To compile you will have to open a terminal at the root of the project folder and type in the terminal:

    make

*You can use the -j{x} option with make and replace {x} with the number of jobs you want to run simultaneously. To summarize if your machine has 4 cores add -j4 to compile faster using the 4 cores instead of one*

Quite simple isn't it? Now the project is ready to run

### Use of the executable

// TODO

### Learn more

You can learn more about the commands you can use with **make** by looking at the *commands.md* file

## Standards used

* [C99](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n897.pdf) - The international standard used for C language
* [Doxygen](http://www.doxygen.nl/) - The comments of our files are based on the file documentation described by the documentation generator Doxygen

## Versioning

We used [git](https://git-scm.com/) for versioning. An online version is hosted on [gitlab](https://gitlab.com/), however the directory is private and only visible to developers
